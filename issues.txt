ISSUES
-----------------------------------------
* What is getidx instruction?
* Figure out the working of compile_function()
* What is OPT_FRAME? Looks like existClosure will always be true as OPT_FRAME
  exists nowhere.
* When does useArguments return true?
* for loop closure part, the 'else' part. See near line 1783.
* won't we run out of registers? The searchUnusedReg() function.
* Line: 680, why take parameter? Function is init_reg_tbl().
-------------------------------------------

ANSWERED
-------------------------------------------
* What does release_reg() do? Where is it defined?
  #Remove it
* Where are variables 't1' and 't2' that appear on
  lines 2092 and 2093 respectively defined ?
  #Remove it
* What is the correct way to distinguish between ival and dval?
  #try truncating (floor function). Do check for overflow.
* What is fl_tbl array used for?
  #fl is frame link, register fl holds the length of the
   register window.
* Understand the whole concept of 'fl'. Also see line 2710.
* Understand the concept of Environment.
  #for scope management
* SETA, GETA nemonics.
  #return value of function.
